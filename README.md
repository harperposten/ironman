Ironman program for SSBU or NASB
This type of Ironman is a gamemode in which two players battle through a number of characters in a random order.
Currently, this program supports Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and Nickelodeon All Star Brawl.
You can choose how many fighters you want to include as well as excluding specific fighters.
You can save the current Ironman as a file and load it later.

To use without an IDE, download the zip and extract the folder. Run Ironman.bat and you're good to go.
