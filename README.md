# ironman
This type of Ironman is a gamemode in which two players battle through a number of characters in a random order.
Currently, this program supports Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and Nickelodeon All Star Brawl.
You can choose how many fighters you want to include as well as excluding specific fighters.
You can save the current Ironman as a file and load it later.

To use without an IDE, download the zip and extract the folder. Run Ironman.bat and you're good to go.

How it works:
You can choose to make a new Ironman or load a previous one.
When making a new one, you choose which game to play, how many fighters to include and which specific fighters, if any, you want to exclude.
On the main menu, there are options for marking a win for either player, undoing previous win, showing the list for both players, saving and closing the program.

To save, choose a file name. If it exists, you can overwrite it. A new .ironman file will be created in the folder.
To load, enter the name of a .ironman file.

Future updates may include the following:
Support for other games
Option to guarantee specific fighters are included
Option to exclude fighters by game (for Smash)
Pictures of roster
Option for choosing stage order
Make it not text-based.
